I was thinking about the algorithm and how it would work, and I used the psuedocode to help implement. I realized I had to end up putting a lot of variables as globals in order to work in the DFS function. One thing I had to account for was the edges of the board to make sure I wouldn't have any errors. |
| January 7 | 7:15-9:30 | I coded the rest of the problem, mainly the findWord method. It was working for some of the test cases but not the others, and I spend a ton of time trying to figure out why. I also kind of forgot what the "code" for the TST class was, but I realized that was similar to the True/False. Eventually (after hours of debugging and printing different things), I realized that the TST dictionary had become corrupted. I forgot to make a NEW TST every single time, so the test cases would just add to the dictionary from previous cases. This made it do all sorts of weird things, but that tiny fix made everthing work and all the test cases were passed.  |
